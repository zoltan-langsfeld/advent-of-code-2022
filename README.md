# advent-of-code-2022

This repository contains the solutions for the challenges found under the Advent of Code 2022 project.

Initially, I wanted to do software engineering instead of purely programming to solve the tasks. It turned out that the
former approach took too much of my time, so on day 3 I decided to focus on speed rather than on maintainability.

**Software Engineering**

Software Engineering can be defined as programming in the function of time.

Key attributes:

* Scalability
* Testing
* Gracious error handling
* Modularity
* Extensibility
* Readibility

**Programming**

* The goal is mostly solving a task quickly without considering the lifespan of the code.
* The points listed under Software Engineering are not important other than having a simple unit test to be able to
  debug the program.

You can read more about the definitions in the
book [Software Engineering @ Google](https://books.google.de/books/about/Software_Engineering_at_Google.html?id=YhUyzgEACAAJ&redir_esc=y)
.
